This project implements a Gym Membership and Fitness Class Booking System using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java.
The goal is to model how gym members book different fitness classes, get charged dynamically, and maintain their account status based on their balance.

🎯 Project Objectives

Apply abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in a realistic scenario.

Design a class hierarchy representing users, fitness classes, and booking behavior.

Demonstrate interface usage and method overriding.

Implement real-world business rules such as:

Dynamic class fees

Weekend discounts

Membership balance validation

| OOP Principle     | How It Is Shown in the Project                                       |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encapsulation** | Member data (balance, ID) hidden behind getters/setters.             |
| **Inheritance**   | All class types inherit from `BookingService`.                       |
| **Polymorphism**  | Child classes override `getFee`, `getDescription`, `chargeFee`.      |
| **Abstraction**   | `BookingService` provides an abstract template for all classes.      |
| **Interfaces**    | `Bookable` ensures all classes are bookable and expose core methods. |



Conclusion

This project successfully implements a modular, maintainable OOP system that models real-world gym class bookings. Through the use of abstract classes, interfaces, inheritance, and encapsulation, the system remains extensible—new classes can easily be added without changing existing code.

It serves as a complete demonstration of core OOP skills in Java while solving a practical, relatable problem scenario.
