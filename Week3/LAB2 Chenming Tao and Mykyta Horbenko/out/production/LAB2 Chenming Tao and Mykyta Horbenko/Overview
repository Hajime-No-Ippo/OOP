We will create a Transport Pass Management System that manages different types of transport passes (BusPass, MetroPass, BikeSharePass) for a user. Each pass type extends an abstract TransportPass class to ensure a standard interface for fare calculation, validity, and owner information.

TransportPass 
    Represents any transport pass
    Variables (private):
        passId (String) — unique identifier for the pass
        ownerName (String) — name of the pass owner
        age (int) — age of the pass owner
        validUntil (LocalDate) — expiration date
    Methods:
        Getters and setters for passId, ownerName, age, validUntil
        isTimeValid() — checks if pass is still valid
        isAgeValid() — checks if owner is old enough to use pass
        Abstract calculateFare(UsagePolicy policy) — overridden in each subclass for specific fare calculation
    Encapsulation ensures controlled access to variables while allowing future validation rules


BusPass (subclass of TransportPass)
    Variables (private):
        km (double) — distance of the trip
        isStudent (boolean) — whether the owner is a student
    Methods:
        Getter/setter for km and isStudent
        calculateFare() — fare depends on distance; student discount applied

MetroPass (subclass of TransportPass)
    Variables (private):
        isStudent (boolean)
        fare (double) — default base fare
    Methods:
        Getter/setter for isStudent and fare
        calculateFare() — fare calculation with student discount

BikeSharePass (subclass of TransportPass)
    Variables (private):
        dayOfRenting (int) — number of days rented
        totalFare (double) — calculated fare
    Methods:
        Getter/setter for dayOfRenting
        calculateFare() — fare depends on number of rental days with tiered pricing

UsagePolicy
    Variables (private):
        zones (String) — zone type (Red, Green, Blue)
        startTime, endTime (LocalTime) — peak hours
    Methods:
        isPeakHour() — checks if current time is peak hour
        calculateFare() — adjusts base fare depending on zone, peak hours, and weekend discount
        printMethods() — prints fare info for current time

PassManager (Device Manager)
    Variable (private): list of TransportPasses
    Methods:
        validatePass(TransportPass pass) — checks if pass is valid and owner is eligible
        renewPass(TransportPass pass, int years) — extends validity of a pass
    Centralizes pass management and ensures consistent rules for all passes

UsageLog
    Variable (private): list of trips for each pass
    Methods:
        addTrip(String trip) — logs a trip
        printLog() — prints all trips

Encapsulation & Scalability:
    All variables are private for controlled access
    Access is only via getters/setters, allowing:
        Validation of inputs (e.g., km, student status)
        Feedback when trying to perform invalid operations (e.g., expired pass)
        Easy extension to add new rules (e.g., restrictions on peak hours or age)
    The design is scalable, supporting new transport types or policies in the future
